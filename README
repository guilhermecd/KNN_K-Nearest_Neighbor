The code is a classifier K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). The basic idea of the algorithm is, have a set of data already classified (called set of training) and have a set of data not yet classified (called test set), to each test file is calculated the similarity between each one of the files of training, this calculation is done using some measure of similarity between the documents, in other words, some distance away. The k most similar training files to test file are selected (k nearest neighbours), and then the file test is classified in particular class according to some criterion of grouping of the k nearest neighbours. The algorithm was implemented in Python.
